# < FOGGYRITO >
Foggyrito is a website designed to let its users create detailed reviews of the best burritos in their city!  Instead of writing and reading generalized ratings/opinions about restaurants, Foggyrito hones in on the most important pieces of information you need to know for your *burrito* specific cravings: What kinds of protein do they offer, what neighborhood is it in, do they SUPER their burritos?  They better...

# Future Plans

In the short term, it will be important to implement more infrastructure that will guide the user to review other specific aspects of the burrito experience e.g. tortilla type, estimated weight of burrito, beans options, salsa options.  Additionally it may be of interest to provide the option to set a score for each of these categories.

Longer term, it would be reasonable to add an editing option for restaurant details and allow end-users to confirm the accuracy of restaurant information.  One priority will be to work on the restaurant search feature- currently it works best to type in the address of the restaurant, since sometimes there are multiple with the same name.
